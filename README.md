# Charpy Impact Test Dataset of Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessel Steels

Authors: Isshu Lee, John W. Merickel, Yugandhar Kasala, Fei Xu, Yalei Tang, Joshua Rittenhouse, Aleksandar Vakanski, Rongjie Song

The dataset contains records of Charpy V-notch impact tests of nuclear structural materials. The focus is on studying the influence of specimen dimensions and geometry on Charpy impact test properties. The dataset was created through an extensive literature review of scientific articles. The extracted data points from the literature review are organized into a tabular format database containing 4,055 test records with 54 parameters, including material type and composition, manufacturing information, irradiation conditions, specimen size and dimensions, and Charpy properties. Materials science experts conducted systematic validation checks to ensure the accuracy of the information related to material type, manufacturing processes, treatment methods, chemical composition, testing conditions, as well as other pertinent information.
